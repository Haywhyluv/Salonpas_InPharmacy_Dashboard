##**Introduction**
This Analysis provides an insight what appears to be a retail marketing campaign conducted across 11 pharmacy stores pan Nigeria. The report is designed to track two primary activities: **product sampling (distributing free samples to engage consumers) and product sales**. It visualizes performance against set targets, identifies trends over the campaign's duration, and highlights the best and worst-performing stores and products (SKUs).

##**Problem Statement**
The analysis seeks to answer critical business questions about the campaign's effectiveness:
1  Are we meeting our overall targets for product sampling and direct sales?
2  Which stores are the most and least effective at converting campaign activities into sales?
3  Is there a direct correlation between the number of samples distributed and the sales achieved in a given store?
4  What was the sales trend throughout the campaign period?
5  Which specific products (SKUs) are driving the majority of the sales?

#**Skills Demonstrated**
In Creating this analysis, some skills was demostrated, which are:
1  BI Tool Proficiency: Competent use of a business intelligence tool (like Power BI or Tableau) to create a multi-faceted report with interactive elements.
2  KPI Tracking: Identifying and prominently displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) for both sampling and sales, comparing actual performance against targets.
3  Comparative Analysis: Effectively using visuals to compare performance across different dimensions, such as store-vs-store, target-vs-actual, and sales-vs-sampling.
4  Data Visualization: Selecting appropriate chart types to represent the data, such as clustered column charts for target vs. actual, line charts for time-series trends, and horizontal bar charts for ranking.

##**Data Transformation**
Based on the visuals, the following data transformations were likely required:
Calculated Measures:
1  % Achieved was calculated for both sampling and sales using the formula: (Actual Value / Target Value).
2  The values in the Top 3 and Lowest 3 charts were likely generated by ranking stores based on aggregated sales and sampling data.
4  Data Aggregation: The raw transactional data (e.g., each individual sale or sample given) was aggregated by store, by week, and by SKU to populate the dashboard visuals.

##**Dimension Tables**:
1  A Stores Dimension with StoreID and StoreName (e.g., "Vanguard Store", "Tonia Pharmacy").
2  A Products Dimension with SKU_ID and SKU_Name (e.g., "BY/10").
3  A Date Dimension containing Date, WeekNumber, etc., to facilitate time-based analysis.
4  A Targets Dimension holding the SalesTarget and SamplingTgt for each store.
5  Relationships would link the StoreID, SKU_ID, and Date in the fact table to their respective dimension tables.

The dashboard presents a clear, albeit mixed, performance story.

Home View Insights (Salon_home.PNG)
1  Overall Performance: The campaign is a success in terms of sales, having achieved 102% of its target (3294 units sold against a target of 3220). However, it is significantly underperforming in its sampling activity, having only used 57% of its target samples (18364 used out of 32200).
2  Store Performance (Sales): The "Sales achieved across each stores" chart shows a clear divide.
3  High Performers: Vanguard Store (418), Boluke Pharmacy (415), and Purelife Pharmacy (394) have significantly surpassed their sales targets (green bar is much taller than the blue bar).
4  Under-performers: Tonia Pharmacy (188), HealthRite Pharmacy (156), and Alpha Toyin (162) have missed their sales targets by a large margin.
5  Weekly Trend: Sales peaked in Week 2 (671) and then experienced a steady decline through Week 5 (456) before a slight recovery in the final week. This mid-campaign slump requires investigation.
6  SKU Performance: The BY/10 SKU is the undisputed star product, with 3294 units sold. This number seems to be the total quantity sold for all SKUs, suggesting BY/10 accounts for the vast majority, if not all, of the sales. 7  7  7  Correction: The total quantity sold is 3294, and the bar for BY/10 also seems to indicate 3294. This is likely a labeling error where the total is mistakenly attributed to one SKU. Assuming the visual scale is correct, BY/10 sold approx. 3300 units, BY/5 sold 526, and SRAY sold 447. This makes BY/10 the dominant product.

Feedback

Clear Objectives: The dashboard does an excellent job of separating and tracking the dual objectives of sampling and sales.
Ranking: The use of "Top 3" and "Lowest 3" views is highly effective for quickly identifying leaders and laggards.
Comparative Insight: The ability to compare top stores by sales versus top stores by sampling is the most powerful analytical feature of this dashboard.

##**Recommendations**
1  Investigate Under-performers: Conduct a deep dive into Tonia, Alpha Toyin, and HealthRite pharmacies. The issue could be low foot traffic, poor staff training on the campaign, or lack of execution.
2  Focus on Winning SKU: Since BY/10 is the dominant seller, ensure it is always in stock across all stores. Analyze why the other SKUs (BY/5, SRAY) are underperforming.
3  Address the Sales Slump: Investigate the cause of the sales decline from Week 3 to Week 5. Was there a drop in marketing efforts, a stock issue, or campaign fatigue?
